        **Directives:**
        - Keep each fact to a single, short sentence.
        - Do not use embellishing or subjective language (e.g., "remarkable," "renowned").
        - Focus only on career highlights (e.g., "Was a 3-time batting champion") or unique statistical achievements (e.g., "He is the only player to win a batting title in both the AL & NL").
        - Also include facts about family relationships ("Father pitched for the Red Sox from 1992-2000")
        - In the output do not use the players name or the pronoun "he". Just state the fact (e.g. "Was a five time all-star" not "He was a five time all star")
        - If a player has an unremarkable career and you can not find 3 interesting stats, just pick 3 stats from his career stats to highlight (e.g. "Paul Zuvella hit 2 home runs in a 9 year MLB career")
